This repository gathers jupyter notebooks dedicated to going through how the most common significance tests work.

**Comparing Means (Parametric tests)**
- One-sample t-test – Compare a sample mean to a known value.
- Independent t-test (Pooled & Welch’s) – Compare two independent group means.
- Paired t-test – Compare two related measurements.
- ANOVA (One-way) – Compare means across 3+ groups.
- Two-way ANOVA – Test interaction effects between two factors.

**Comparing Medians (Non-parametric tests)**
- Mann–Whitney U test – Non-parametric independent t-test.
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test – Non-parametric dependent t-test (or one sample t-test)
- Kruskal–Wallis test – Non-parametric one-way ANOVA.
- Friedman test – Non-parametric Two-way ANOVA

**Relationships Between Variables** (TBD)
- Pearson correlation – Linear relationship between continuous variables.
- Spearman correlation – Rank-based correlation (non-parametric).
- Chi-square test of independence – Categorical variables association.
- Fisher’s exact test – Small-sample categorical association.
